# Goal-Keeper

Goal Keeper is a website to help people keep track of their goals. It can be used to create goals, monitor goals, view statistics about your goals, and view your history of goal completion. It is completely free and it exists because I believe that writing goals is an incredibly important part of life and should be easily accessible to all people.

## Purpose

The purpose of Goal Keeper is to make it simple and easy to keep track of your goals digitally. Writing Goals has become a big part of my life and is what keeps me on track to do the things that I want to do, but writing goals is in desperate need of a modern update. I hope that Goal Keeper can fill this void, and assist people in keeping track of their goals in a way that feels comfortable and user-friendly to them. While writing your goals down on paper can be effective, there is no reason to not make this process better by allowing you to access them on your phone, computer, or any other device that you have with web access. Additionally, with Goal Keeper not only can you see your goals, but you can track your progress, change your goals to reflect your current needs, and give your goals ratings so that you will know how how close you are to accomplishing them.

## Technology

Goal Keeper was built with the following technologies:

* PHP
* JavaScript
* MySQL
* HMTL
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Plotly JavaScript Library

Notes: PHP is used to handle anything server or user-information related, while JavaScript handles some of the page formatting and is also responsible for producing the graphs on the home page. Bootstrap's grid system provides easy, and consistent page formatting and reliable scaling between mobile and desktop versions of the site. Plotly is a JavaScript library that allows data to easily be formatted and graphed according to the needs of the data. Goal Keeper uses a 1-10 scale for rating goals, so the most effective portrayal of this data is to use a barchart for individual goals. 

## Features

* Create Goals based on how long it will take to accomplish them (day, week, month, year, all-time)
* Track and monitor your goals by adding journals to your goals, giving them ratings, or editing them
* View useful statistics about your goal progress
* View all of the goals you have completed to see how many of your goals you have completed
